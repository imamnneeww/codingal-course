<!-- What is Bootstrap?

- Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework that helps developers design websites quickly without writing a lot of custom CSS and JavaScript.

- It comes with ready-made styles, layouts, and components like buttons, grids, forms, and navigation bars.

- Bootstrap makes websites responsive, meaning they adjust to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Why Use Bootstrap?

1. Saves Time – You don’t have to write a lot of CSS from scratch.

2. Responsive Design – Websites automatically fit on different devices.

3. Pre-Styled Components – Includes ready-to-use buttons, cards, modals, etc.

4. Easy to Use – Just add Bootstrap classes to your HTML elements.
